guadec-talks.html is the HTML file of the registration.guadec.org talk list
schedule is a copy paste from ods, i.e. do:
 * cat >schedule
 * copy paste into terminal
 * hit enter and ctrl+d

ods format:
 first row: room names
 after that, the following columns:
  * day, set current day should just be 1,2,3 for first slot on the day
  * time: the start time of the slot
  * n rows for event titles
 There are some special titles, if these occur then the slot will be ignored for schedule.xml creation:
  * Lunchbreak
  * Coffebreak
  * Closing
 use on of these or leave all rooms empty to set the end time of the previous slot.

./parse-talks.py guadec-talks.html schedule
xmllint --format schedule.xml


TODO:
 * verify schedule.xml is correct
 * verify ods format is OK
 * Some missing tags/attributes:
   - slurp
   - talk uuid
   - person ID (probably mandatory even if unused)
   - â€¦
