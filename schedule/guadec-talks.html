    <h3>Flow graphs in GNOME and Gtk+</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Flowgraphs are awesome. Like no other widget they feel intuitive, are straightforward to use.

In this talk I will take you on a short tour that shows you where to find flow graphs in common Free software.

Then I will show you libgtkflow, a library built upon the GNOME stack that makes it easy for you to use flow graphs in your own Gtk-based applications.

After this I want to discuss the future use of flow-graphs in GNOME-related software.

    <h3>Growing an Open Source Community</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Open source projects are always understaffed. In this talk methods to increase the public visibility of your project as well as gain, keep and grow newcomers to maintainers will be presented.

All methods are shown on the practical example and how they have - or not have - proven to be useful for the coala community. They focus on lowering the entry barrier as much as possible as well as rewarding successes and building a continuous learning process with the community.

    <h3>What makes a web service free as in freedom?</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    GNOME provides a complete free software desktop. If you run it yourself you have all the benefits of free software, the freedoms to use, study, share, and improve the software. You are in control of what you do with your computer.

The situation is different when using software which is run by others as a service, even if these others run free software. There you don&#x27;t have control about what software is run and how. What does that mean for your freedoms? How much control do you still have? Do you know what is happening to your data? Do you have the freedom to switch to a different service? How is your own freedom affecting the freedom of other users of the same service? There are a lot of questions like these.

There are a couple of approaches how to address these questions. There are the user data manifesto [1], the &quot;Terms of Service; Didn&#x27;t Read&quot; site [2], the GNU ethical repository criteria [3], and other attempts at covering specific aspects of freedom of web services. But there is no definition yet what makes a web service free as in freedom, which is as concise and elegant as the free software definition is.

This presentation will give an overview of where we are, what approaches to defining the freedom of web services exist, and what is missing. It&#x27;s intended to start a discussion which leads to a definition of what a web service has to provide to give users the same freedom as they have when running free software themselves. This is the beginning of a journey and everybody who cares about freedom is invited to join.

    <h3>GTK: are we in the future, yet?</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    GTK is an old tool kit; it turns 20 in 2007. While its history is a long, unbroken chain of progress, GTK is, at its heart, heavily based on how we used to do things in GUI tool kits two decades ago. Over the past 5 years, since the 3.0 release, the GTK team has been hard at work into bringing the tool kit internals kicking and screaming into the XXI century. This has inevitably caused some friction with application developers, but it has also opened an entire world of possibilities.

In this talk I&#x27;ll outline where we are coming from, what has changed, where we&#x27;re going in the future — and how we&#x27;ll get there.

    <h3>WebKit Security Updates</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Major Linux distributions have a problem with WebKit security. Whereas major desktop browsers push automatic security updates directly to users on a regular basis so that users don’t have to worry about updates, Linux users are dependent on their distributions to release updates. Well over 100 vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution were fixed in WebKit last year, so getting updates out to users is critical. This talk examines the disconnect between how the WebKit project handles security issues upstream and how different major distributions do (or do not) handle security issues, shows that WebKit security issues have widespread impact even for users who do not use a WebKit-based web browser, and discusses the security consequences of the split between the original WebKit API and WebKit2.

    <h3>How do/could we store secrets in GNOME?</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    This is a summary of the infrastructure that GNOME provides to store secrets like passwords, SSH and GPG keys, and X.509 certificates.

Our infrastructure is more or less adequate within GNOME, but it interfaces poorly with other pieces of infrastructure that people use, like Firefox, 2-Factor Authentication hardware, and password managers for mobile devices.

We will describe some use cases and some ways in which GNOME could be improved to accomodate cross-platform, cross-device, cross-team password storage.

    <h3>Accessibility and the Free Desktop</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    There are around 285 million visually impaired people in the world, out of which around 38-39 million are completely blind. One interesting fact is that over 15 million of blind people are from India, and similarly a large number is from different developing or undeveloped countries, and poor socioeconomic status. There is a lot of software available for accessibility, and most of it is extremely unaccessible, both economically and socially. This is where Free Software comes in. Free Software desktops, especially GNOME, have made large strides in accessibility in the last few years, and are proving to be an effective way of reaching these people, introducing them to a whole new world of computers. 

I&#x27;m going to talk about how Free Software enables people to expand upon accessibility software, add regional languages, and helps people in bad socioeconomic settings. I&#x27;ll then proceed to show a 2-3 minute demo of how the universal access features of GNOME work, and what we need to improve.

    <h3>A GLib look at structured logging</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Structured logging is a handy feature of modern log systems, like journald. GLib is growing functionality to allow applications to export log messages in structured form, which allows developers and sysadmins to more easily search and sort log messages to find what they&#x27;re looking for.

This talk will introduce the new APIs and give an overview of how applications and libraries should log in the new world order.

    <h3>GNOME Software: You&#x27;ll Never Guess What Comes Next</h3>

    GNOME Software is an project that started life as an application installer, and over time picked up features such as updating system firmware, distribution upgrades, installation of fonts, codecs, language packs, and handling RPM files and Flatpak bundles. With screenshots, long descriptions and now user-submitted ratings and reviews we&#x27;re on parity with several other appstores like the Google play store and provide a fast, stable and beautiful software center for Fedora. In this talk I will explain about how we built this beast, show off some new features and also talk about the future. I&#x27;ll allow lots of time for questions and comments.

Notes: This is a talk that Richard Hughes is going to present at Flock and me at GUADEC. Also happy to do a short version of it if a 25 minute slot works better schedule wise.

    &quot;ZeMarmot&quot; is a project of 2D animation movie, to be released under CC By-SA/Free Art licenses and fully made with creative Free Software. In particular, it is currently fully digitally drawn on GIMP, video-edited in Blender and sound-edited with Ardour.
Our desktop of choice is GNOME, under a GNU/Linux operating system.

We will present the film project and its status, what happened in the last year since we started the project, but also how we contribute back, since Jehan, scenarist of ZeMarmot, has also been an active contributor of GIMP and other Free Software for several years.

Finally we would like to raise the question: is GNOME ready for the creative artists? We may not have the full answer, but a part of it!

----

ZeMarmot&#x27;s director, Aryeom Han, is a young South Korean director of animation film, whose first co-directed short animation got screened in several festivals and won 2 prices, and later worked on corporate videos and several projects. Together with Jehan, they also won a &quot;Firefox Flicks&quot; price in 2012, in &quot;New Technology&quot; category, for an animation augmented through HTML5.

    <h3>Making your GNOME app compile 2.4x faster</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    ... with the Meson build system on Linux, and ~15x faster on Windows.

Last year, Jussi Pakkanen (the maintainer of Meson) gave a talk about improving the way GNOME apps are built by replacing Autotools with the Meson build system.

This year, I&#x27;ll be talking about how we at Centricular worked along exactly those lines and ported GStreamer, GLib, and its core dependencies from Autotools to Meson. Besides the improvements in speed, using Meson provided numerous advantages over Autotools such as cleaner syntax, better cross-platform support, maintainable code, and much more.

I will be talking about our porting journey and make the case that Meson is indeed ready for replacing Autotools in every case we&#x27;ve seen so far. The next step is convincing more projects to try out Meson.

    <h3>Reworking the desktop distribution</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    The traditional model of a GNOME desktop is tightly tied to the traditional model of a Linux distribution: many packages that are individually installed onto the users system; some are low-level system services, some are core desktop components, and some are applications. While in some ways very
flexible, this model is also fragile: the continuing correct operation of the system depends on a complex dance of installation and upgrades of thousands
of packages. Systems based on free software components, from OLPC, to ChromeOS, to Android have moved away from this model, but are no longer recognizable as a Linux distribution.

Upcoming releases of Fedora Workstation will offer an alternate installation method where the operating system is distributed as an ostree image and atomically upgraded as a whole, while applications are installed on top as xdg-app bundles. The intent is to provide an experience that is much more
robust than the traditional package-based installation, while providing additional flexibility in installing applications. Applications will no
longer be strictly bound to the Fedora package set, making it easy for third parties to provide applications that work across multiple distributions and distribution versions. The talk will go over the underlying technologies and discuss how they interact with a traditional distribution ecosystem, and with
the evolving ecosystem of xdg-app. There will also be discussion of how users, such as developers, need to work differently on such a system, and how we can best enable that.

    <h3>A Look Behind the Curtain—how the Foundation runs</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Have you ever wondered what the GNOME Foundation actually does? What do the employees do to keep the Foundation running? I will cover the details on what is required to keep the Foundation active and solvent.  Come see the challenges we face and maybe even see what you can do to help!

    <h3>An Asynchronous Internet for GNOME</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    While most of the developed world has decent internet access, this is not universally distributed. In much of the developing world, people have very incomplete and spotty access to the internet.

At Endless, we are shipping GNOME into that environment. We&#x27;ve had a number of challenges in modifying the desktop to work within these constraints. The end result is a version of GNOME that is useful and relevant both with and without a network enabled.

    <h3>Building GTK+ applications for Windows with MinGW</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    While there have been great strides in building the GTK+ stack on Windows, cross-building for Windows from Linux is still the easiest way for most developers to build their applications. I will demonstrate, using the Fedora MinGW project, how to build a GTK+ application, including a simple installer to bundle all the dependencies into a single distributable file.

    <h3>Building an automotive platform from GNOME</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    With the success of connected cars, there is an increasing demand for a secure, consumer-oriented infotainment platform. The open source application framework &quot;Apertis&quot; serves as embedded end-to-end solution in the automotive environment. With many contributions to the GNOME technologies over the years and its own Free software components, Apertis is truly a unique product in the automotive world which pushes the boundaries of a traditionally closed source environment.

Security is guaranteed by multiple lines of defense, including MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and xdg-app as sandboxing mechanism. D-Bus provides a stable SDK-API to the app-developer.
