A graph based application to be able to check the health of the GNOME games built using python and neo4j.
-*- Check which gnome modules builds are failing/passing/timing out/missing from gnome-continuous builds
-*- Find their dependencies
-*- Run queries on a graph to find out what possibly broke a module. For example: Find out which dependencies are used exclusively by the failing modules as an indication that the dependency is broken.

In much of the developing world, people have very incomplete and spotty access to the internet.

At Endless, we are shipping GNOME into that environment. We&amp;#x27;ve had a number of challenges in modifying the desktop to work within these constraints. The end result is a version of GNOME that is useful and relevant both with and without a network enabled.</abstract><slug /><date>2016-07-12T10:00:00+0200</date><track /><start>10:00</start><type>lecture</type><duration>01:00</duration><description /><attachments /><day>1</day><links /><room>Room 1</room><logo /><language>eng</language><persons><person>Jonathan Blandford</person></persons></event><event><day>1</day><title>Unconference #1</title><abstract>Yet to be announced</abstract><date>2016-07-12T13:30:00+0200</date><duration>00:30</duration><type>lecture</type><start>13:30</start><room>Room 1</room><language>eng</language><persons /></event><event><day>1</day><title>Keynote 1</title><abstract>Yet to be announced</abstract><date>2016-07-12T12:00:00+0200</date><duration>01:00</duration><type>lecture</type><start>12:00</start><room>Room 1</room><language>eng</language><persons /></event></room><room name="Room 2"><event><recording><opt_out>false</opt_out><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license></recording><title>Growing an Open Source Community</title><abstract>Open source projects are always understaffed. In this talk methods to increase the public visibility of your project as well as gain, keep and grow newcomers to maintainers will be presented.

All methods are shown on the practical example and how they have - or not have - proven to be useful for the coala community. They focus on lowering the entry barrier as much as possible as well as rewarding successes and building a continuous learning process with the community.</abstract><slug /><date>2016-07-12T10:00:00+0200</date><track /><start>10:00</start><type>lecture</type><duration>01:00</duration><description /><attachments /><day>1</day><links /><room>Room 2</room><logo /><language>eng</language><persons><person>Lasse Schuirmann</person></persons></event><event><recording><opt_out>false</opt_out><license>CC BY-SA 4.0</license></recording><title>Modular UIs for Offline Content</title><abstract>Endless devices include a lot of content downloaded from the internet so people without internet connections can have access to it. We create lots of apps to organize and present the content.

We are creating a &amp;quot;modular&amp;quot; system for putting together apps quickly, and it&amp;#x27;s built on GTK. (Think one level higher than GTK widgets.) I&amp;#x27;ll talk about what such a system should and shouldn&amp;#x27;t do, and about pushing some of GTK&amp;#x27;s limits.</abstract><slug /><date>2016-07-12T11:00:00+0200</date><track /><start>11:00</start><type>lecture</type><duration>00:30</duration><description /><attachments /><day>1</day><links /><room>Room 2</room><logo /><language>eng</language><persons><person>Philip Chimento</person></persons></event><event><day>1</day><title>Unconference #2</title><abstract>Yet to be announced</abstract><date>2016-07-12T13:30:00+0200</date><duration>00:30</duration><type>lecture</type><start>13:30</start><room>Room 2</room><language>eng</language><persons /></event></room></day><day date="2016-07-13" index="2"><room name="Room 1" /><room name="Room 2" /></day><day date="2016-07-14" index="3"><room name="Room 1" /><room name="Room 2" /></day></schedule>
