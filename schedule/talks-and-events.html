In case of Fedora it's RPM packages. They have served us well, but they also have a number of shortcomings: with small individual components the testing matrix explodes when we have to consider different package versions, and upgrading such systems is often irreversable.</p><p>In this talk I will lay out a plan how we are going to put together an atomic base system in Fedora Workstation with flatpaks for individual applications. I will demo the latest progress we've made and show a great many screenshots.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-52-bringing_gnome_home_to_ubuntu"><h4><a href="/schedule/#52-bringing_gnome_home_to_ubuntu">Bringing GNOME home to Ubuntu</a></h4><span class="details">On Sunday at 14:00 (Turing - G29) by Tim Lunn</span><p>I am a co-founder and technical lead of Ubuntu GNOME, with our goal to bring a pure GNOME experience to Ubuntu some might wonder where that might be heading given the recently annouced decision for Canonical to drop Unity and switch to GNOME. This will bring a new set of challenges for the Ubuntu GNOME team, while our distro will not likely exist as a seperate entity and we will merge development resources with the Canonical desktop team, we will remain as a community team to avoid the possible distinction between community and Canonical may getting blurred.</p><p>I will open my talk with a brief history of the Ubuntu GNOME project, why we started it and what our goals were. We started the project with goal of bring pure gnome-shell to Ubuntu. At the time GNOME 3 was incredibly broken on both Ubuntu and Debian to the the point of being unusable. We managed to get things into really good shape over the years but there have been challenges, mostly relating to the co-existence with Unity, and having to maintain large patch delta’s to work with Unity also.</p><p>Then comes the exciting stuff what is the future of GNOME on Ubuntu, where does the Ubuntu GNOME team stand in the future? Canonical are already showing some resistance towards core components of the GNOME stack, for example things like tracker and gdm. What part will Ubuntu GNOME play in pushing our visions into the core Ubuntu Future GNOME desktop? I can’t be incredibly specific on this at this point we are still in discussions with Canonical teams at this stage, but all should be clear by GUADEC. This should fill the bulk of my talk, I see exciting oppurtunities ahead and some more challenges going forward before we can get Canonical aligned with GNOME. I will discuss these in detail during my talk.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-68-building_a_secure_desktop_with_gnome_technologies"><h4><a href="/schedule/#68-building_a_secure_desktop_with_gnome_technologies">Building a secure desktop with GNOME technologies</a></h4><span class="details">On Sunday at 11:30 (Hopper - G44) by Matthew Garrett</span><p>The move towards Wayland and container-isolated application deployment brings a range of security benefits. But broad isolation isn't enough - we still need fine-grained control over access to resources, otherwise it's still practical for a single compromised application to leak significant quantities of personal data.</p><p>This presentation will examine existing application isolation mechanisms and identify cases where they fall short. It will then go on to cover existing kernel technologies that allow us to provide even stronger restrictions and control, and how it's possible for us to build environments that provide high levels of security without forcing users to give up the freedom to run whatever software they want.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-16-building_interfaces_from_the_future"><h4><a href="/schedule/#16-building_interfaces_from_the_future">Building interfaces from the future</a></h4><span class="details">On Sunday at 10:30 (Hopper - G44) by Tobias Bernard</span><p>Animations are the future of interface design. They enable developers to make interfaces more understandable by offloading processes from the user's brain to the screen. However, in many cases animations are simply added as transitions between independently designed screens. This can result in animations contradicting each other spatially. I co-wrote an article about why this is a problem [1] and outlined a solution: Designing semantic components which change over time, and then using these to compose interfaces.</p><p>Even though the industry seems to largely agree that this is the way forward, there are very few interfaces implementing these ideas. I believe the main reason for this is that the current generation of layout technologies is built for static layouts with strict hierarchies. This makes it prohibitively difficult to build interfaces where components move fluidly between different states.</p><p>I will show some interface prototypes I built and explain why they were so difficult to implement with current technology. Finally, I will outline some ideas for a better layout API, to make building awesome, fluid interfaces from the future more feasible.</p><p>[1] https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-50-building_your_gnome_app_anywhere_with_meson"><h4><a href="/schedule/#50-building_your_gnome_app_anywhere_with_meson">Building your GNOME app anywhere with Meson</a></h4><span class="details">On Saturday at 10:00 (Turing - G29) by Nirbheek Chauhan</span><p>With the new contribution workflow enabled by GNOME Builder, it is now trivially easy for newcomers to clone a project, build it, and hack on it.</p><p>This talk is about how you can use Meson's subprojects and wrapdb to have a very similar experience on any operating system with just Meson and git.</p><p>At the same time, this feature is also distro-friendly since all this machinery can be turned off with a single option, telling Meson to only use dependencies provided by the system.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-15-continuous_past_present_and_future"><h4><a href="/schedule/#15-continuous_past_present_and_future">Continuous: Past, Present, and Future</a></h4><span class="details">On Saturday at 12:15 (Turing - G29) by Emmanuele Bassi</span><p>Since 2012, a service in the GNOME infrastructure has been constantly building GNOME modules, committing the result to Ostree, and running automated tests on the whole OS.

Just one problem, this is a road long travelled before, such as in the application dark ages of Win32 applications and DLLs. And it worked out so wonderfully there... Do we risk a future where, like the resurrected dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, this family of applications will break their containment and start eating our users? This session will try to present a balanced argument about the situation, frankly discussing the benefits promised by these technologies, but highlighting the very real issues and risks their widespread adoption could, and in some cases are, already bringing to the table.</p><p>The talk with cover the promised benefits of application containers, such as AppImage, Snappy and Flatpak. It will detail the empowerment of developers who use the technologies, the ability for upstream projects to have a much closer role in delivering their software, and the benefits that brings to both the upstream projects and their users. But as a counter to those benefits, the session will detail some of the risks and responsibilities that come with that technology. The complexities of library integration, the risk of introducing new forms of dependency issues, and the transference of responsibility for those issues, plus security, away from the current Distributions delivering upstream projects towards those upstream projects directly. As a conclusion, the session will present some suggestions to upstream projects adopting these technologies to start them down the road of accepting those responsibilities directly, or working more closely with existing Distribution projects to share the burdens these technologies now provide.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-20-robustness_of_gnome"><h4><a href="/schedule/#20-robustness_of_gnome">Robustness of GNOME</a></h4><span class="details">On Sunday at 12:15 (Hopper - G44) by Jonathan Kang, Chingkai Chu</span><p>I'm Jonathan Kang, a GNOME hacker from China.

A very challenging series of steps has been simplified: the app source will be located and downloaded automatically, then displayed in GNOME Builder and from there it can be explored, modified and run.</p><p>The Feature spawns across three core GNOME technologies: the EOS Shell (derivative of the GNOME Shell), Flatpak and GNOME Builder.</p><p>The authors aim is that this talk is suitable for a broad audience, hoping to find the right balance between demonstrating the user interaction, talking about design decisions and giving an technical overview of the components involved.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-7-state_of_the_builder"><h4><a href="/schedule/#7-state_of_the_builder">State of the Builder</a></h4><span class="details">On Friday at 12:15 (Turing - G29) by Christian Hergert</span><p>Another yearly update on what Builder can do for you, what has been added, and how your contribution workflow can be simplified.</p><p>Some topics include:</p><p> - Making your development setup quick &amp; easy w/ Flatpak<br /> - Profiling your project to find performance issues<br /> - New build systems and integration points for plugin authors<br /> - Debugging your project<br /> - How to quickly start contributing to an existing project</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-72-the_gnome_way"><h4><a href="/schedule/#72-the_gnome_way">The GNOME Way</a></h4><span class="details">On Friday at 10:30 (Hopper - G44) by Allan Day</span><p>This year, GNOME turns 20. Over the course of its history, the project has pioneered new ways of working and has set out a powerful mission for itself: from championing usability and accessibility, to establishing the six month release cycle, GNOME has been at the forefront of Free Software development. However, there are also risks for a project that has been running this long: collective knowledge can be forgotten, and it is easy to lose touch with the beliefs that give a project purpose.</p><p>In this talk, I'll ask the question: what is it that defines the GNOME project? In attempting to provide my own answer, I'll describe the principles that I think make GNOME so important. I'll also recount stories from GNOME's history, and in so doing make a case for what constitutes the project's folklore. Finally, I'll ask the question: how do we ensure that, as GNOME looks to the future, the project continues to nurture these traditions?</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-60-the_history_of_gnome"><h4><a href="/schedule/#60-the_history_of_gnome">The History of GNOME</a></h4><span class="details">On Saturday at 14:00 (Turing - G29) by Jonathan Blandford</span><p>Happy Birthday GNOME! Ever wonder why the project is the way it is? The GNOME project has had a long and exciting ride to this point.

It has provided a common metadata store for applications to share, making all of the data a giant interconnected graph.</p><p>However, times change. There's now initiatives like flatpak that make this interconnected graph more accessory, or even not desirable. This talk will cover the plans to make Tracker a good citizen in the sandboxing world, and what this means for applications.</p></div><div class="abstract" id="abstract-22-whats_coverity_static_analysis_ever_done_for_us"><h4><a href="/schedule/#22-whats_coverity_static_analysis_ever_done_for_us">What’s Coverity static analysis ever done for us?</a></h4><span class="details">On Sunday at 10:30 (Turing - G29) by Philip Withnall</span><p>Various GNOME modules have been building on Coverity Scan for the last year. Has it been finding legitimate bugs, or ones which people are almost never going to hit? What’s the best way to use static analysis? Why should developers care?</p><p>Warning: This talk will contain Jenkins and graphs.</p></div></div>
