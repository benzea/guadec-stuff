    <h3>Resurrecting dinosaurs, what can possibly go wrong</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Containerised Application technologies like AppImage, Snappy and Flatpak promise a brave new world for Linux applications, free from the worries of shared libraries and dependency issues. Just one problem, this is a road long travelled before, such as in the application dark ages of Win32 applications and DLLs. And it worked out so wonderfully there... Do we risk a future where, like the resurrected dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, this family of applications will break their containment and start eating our users? This session will try to present a balanced argument about the situation, frankly discussing the benefits promised by these technologies, but highlighting the very real issues and risks their widespread adoption could, and in some cases are, already bringing to the table.<br><br>The talk with cover the promised benefits of application containers, such as AppImage, Snappy and Flatpak. It will detail the empowerment of developers who use the technologies, the ability for upstream projects to have a much closer role in delivering their software, and the benefits that brings to both the upstream projects and their users. But as a counter to those benefits, the session will detail some of the risks and responsibilities that come with that technology. The complexities of library integration, the risk of introducing new forms of dependency issues, and the transference of responsibility for those issues, plus security, away from the current Distributions delivering upstream projects towards those upstream projects directly. As a conclusion, the session will present some suggestions to upstream projects adopting these technologies to start them down the road of accepting those responsibilities directly, or working more closely with existing Distribution projects to share the burdens these technologies now provide.

    <h3>Automating Decryption of Removable Devices</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    GNOME has long supported encryption of removable devices such as USB keys; protecting data at rest from casual theft. But the increasing scale of such infrastructure has brought demands for automation. Automation can also enable administrators to protect the encrypted data&#x27;s key even from the bearer of the removable device.<br><br>This talk will cover the current state of automated decryption, including the new algorithms implemented by the Clevis and Tang projects. It will also discuss the current state of integration of Clevis with GNOME, including a demo of automated unlocking and mounting.

    <h3>Replacing C library code with Rust: what I learned</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    I have been working on replacing the C code in librsvg, GNOME&#x27;s SVG rendering library, with Rust.  Rust is one of the few high-level languages that actually generates object code, which in turn can be linked into compiled C code.<br><br>What started as an experiment in replacing gnarly C code with clean Rust code, eventually turned into a full porting effort.  Librsvg&#x27;s public API/ABI remain the same as before, and only the internals have Rust code in them.  The result is a much safer library with trustworthy code.  Not only is the code safe by Rust&#x27;s nature; it now has a bunch of unit tests that would have been very cumbersome to write before.<br><br>This talk will explore:<br><br>* Brief intro to Rust&#x27;s benefits and philosophy.<br><br>* Tips for replacing C code with Rust.<br><br>* Refactorings that are needed in C to replace it with Rust.<br><br>* Refactorings that are possible once Rust is in place.<br><br>* Going from a codebase with zero unit tests to one that has a bunch of tests!<br><br>* Having a mixture of C and Rust code for certain implementation patterns.<br><br>* Replacing scary C parsers with safe Rust parsers.<br><br>* How Rust clarified my thinking.<br><br>* Can distros ship this?<br><br>* Should we replace GNOME library code with Rust, in general?

    Most of the applications that GNOME are programmed in GTK (among other programming languages), and as it well known that the majority of attendances at GUADEC are programmers that have used GTK at least once; learning it, took me a while to finally teach it to newcomers. <br>It is not enough to have your hands dirty to program in GTK, it is also necessary to follow patterns that GNOME have set for its projects. <br>I will show basics forms that I have done in some workshops in my local community according to the Web documentation available, and also propose a way to teach GTK for newcomers and demonstrate that the advantages of learning GTK are beyond the GNOME project.

    <h3>GCompris the joruney untold</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    GCompris can be seen as a success in the Free Software community in reaching a large audience by leveraging the multi-platform nature of Qt. <br>GCompris is a high-quality educational software suite comprising of numerous activities for children aged 2 to 10. It started its journey in 2002 with Gnome and gtk+. It has been a long and wonderful journey since then. However we started on a journey to replace the gtk+ version with Qt version. We have ported 137 activities since then and more are being developed with time.<br>The talk will begin with our so far journey and why we decided to port to Qt from gtk+. It will include the uphills of both the gtk+ and Qt and that why we decided to make such an important decision to write GCompris completely from scratch after 12 years of its development and how it has been so far.<br>Then it will cover the journey of an infant to a contributor with GCompris which will also cover different parts of GCompris and will help people who want to contribute to it.<br><br>1. So, the journey starts with an infant who comes across GCompris and explores its different sections from mathematical to language to science and mouse coordination. The activities are divided into various genres and difficulty on the basis of age levels and type of activity which will be shown which helps the infant to grow which is their first involvement with GCompris by using it. GCompris is completely supported in 17 languages and partially supported in 15+ other languages.<br><br>2. The infant then grows to a child and thinks of creating his/her own activity. Then they come across the architecture of GCompris which will be explained in depth in the talk which has:<br>1. A C++ core in src/core<br>2. QML activities in src/activities<br>3. Each activity in its folder<br>4. An activity can extend an other one and provide it a dataset<br>5. At compilation time each activity is zipped in a ‘rcc’ file which is loaded at run time. <br><br>3. The child than grows and gets curious further on how to contribute. Then he finally learns how to get started in the project that he played while he was an infant so that he/she can be equip other infants with more activities.<br>They learn about <br>1. GCompris Codebase which covers activity Development<br>2. Compilation chain in CMake<br>3. Core Development which includes<br>a) Activity API<br>b) C++ Widgets<br>c) QML Widgets<br>4. Documentation<br>5. Graphics<br>6. Packaging<br>7. Localization.<br><br>4. Then the infant who earlier played with the activities finally decides the area of interest and finally turns into a contributor :)<br><br>The talk would cover our success story so far and how we are helping an infant to grow and finally contribute to a project they once used along with the future state which would be to take GCompris to as many schools/kids as we can so that every infant understand their power and contributes to the community.<br>It will also cover the role of teachers who turn into contributors to facilitate and help their pupils and bringing/making this academia a fun way to learn.

    <h3>Continuous: Past, Present, and Future</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Since 2012, a service in the GNOME infrastructure has been constantly building GNOME modules, committing the result to Ostree, and running automated tests on the whole OS. From a single Git commit to a full blown virtual machine in a matter of minutes. This service is called GNOME Continuous, our own continuous integration and delivery pipeline.<br><br>Continuous has been the major driver to improve the quality of the whole GNOME project: for developers, by building their work; for designers, by providing a bootable VM to perform design iteration and QA; to newcomers, by ensuring that tools like jhbuild would be more reliable; to distributors and OSVs, who could ensure their products would be based on a reliable set of components.<br><br>In this presentation we will talk about how Continuous came to be, thanks to the work of Colin Walters; how it works; what are the goals of a CI/CD pipeline like Continuous; and where do we go from here.

    <h3>Building interfaces from the future</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Animations are the future of interface design. They enable developers to make interfaces more understandable by offloading processes from the user&#x27;s brain to the screen. However, in many cases animations are simply added as transitions between independently designed screens. This can result in animations contradicting each other spatially. I co-wrote an article about why this is a problem [1] and outlined a solution: Designing semantic components which change over time, and then using these to compose interfaces.<br><br>Even though the industry seems to largely agree that this is the way forward, there are very few interfaces implementing these ideas. I believe the main reason for this is that the current generation of layout technologies is built for static layouts with strict hierarchies. This makes it prohibitively difficult to build interfaces where components move fluidly between different states.<br><br>I will show some interface prototypes I built and explain why they were so difficult to implement with current technology. Finally, I will outline some ideas for a better layout API, to make building awesome, fluid interfaces from the future more feasible.<br><br>[1] https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design

    <h3>Please Use GNOME Web</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    The web browser is indisputably the single most important component of any operating system, and GNOME is no exception. Cross-platform browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome work well everywhere, but at the expense of platform integration. Cross-platform browsers cannot deliver a well-integrated user experience comparable to the Microsoft Edge or Safari web browsers. If you haven&#x27;t used one of these two browsers recently, you might not even realize what you&#x27;re missing on Linux. GNOME Web is the only browser that can seriously hope to provide comparable desktop integration and user experience, but it suffers from lack of users and contributors. Distributions that ship GNOME with Firefox, as well as GNOME contributors that primarily use other browsers, are seriously harming our effort to improve GNOME Web. To improve quality, we need all GNOME hands on deck to test regular daily usage of GNOME Web, report bugs, and attract new users and contributors.

    <h3>Variable Fonts for the Linux desktop and beyond</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    In September 2016, OpenType 1.8 introduced the biggest change to font formatting in twenty years: support for &quot;variable fonts&quot;, in which complete font families can be compactly encoded into a single file. Variable fonts can declare multiple axes of variation — weight, width, optical size, slant, and more — on which the letterforms can be interpolated in software on the fly. The new format offers considerable benefits for developers and end users, but supporting it will require changes throughout the software stack.<br><br>This talk will explain the new format, how it can be used on Linux systems and other free-software platforms, and what will be entailed in implementing it. Support for variable fonts is already available at the rasterizer level, but enabling GNOME and GTK+ applications to use variable fonts will require changes to how fonts are enumerated on the system, how they are presented to the user, and how they are accessed by toolkit components. The user experience for font selection may need rethinking, and open-source fonts themselves may even need reengineering.  The good news is that proprietary software projects face the same challenges, and free software has an opportunity to help set the standard going forward.

    <h3>Recipes - Lessons learned from creating a new app</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Cooking and recipes is not a new topic for the GNOME community.<br>All the way back to 2007, the idea of a GNOME cook book was already around (https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeCookbook). For one reason or another, we never quite got there - but the idea has stuck around, and after Guadec last year, the two of us got together to finally make GNOME recipes a reality.<br><br>Our talk will cover the original design goals and the evolution of the design from paper mock-ups and ideas, to refining a raw prototype and to the complete application that we have to today. We will touch on the interaction between design and development and how you can be successful in this even when you have to bridge a 7 hour time differential.<br><br>We will take a look ahead at whats coming in 3.26, and how the original design goals are evolving and expanding as we build out the application.<br> <br>On the technical side, we will explore some of the challenges and lessons learned during the development of recipes, and we will explain how writing this application was useful for developing and refining new technologies such as sandboxes, portals and new build systems. There may be an aside about portability.<br><br>Of course, there will be a demo of recipes.

    <h3>What Future Internet brings to Endless</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    ... and what it can bring to GNOME<br><br>At endlessm.com we&#x27;re betting on the NDN (Named Data Networks, sometimes called CCN: Content Centric Networking) technology for distributed updates of our content apps. This novel (i.e. nearing 20 years in research) technology is really a new way of thinking about how applications relate to data.<br><br>Modern world networking is centred on the IP paradigm: we route addresses, everything ends up talking IP. This vision is a great solution to the problem of having an ubiquitous network that can have a diversity of technologies in all it&#x27;s layers: DVB, ethernet, 3g will become IP that will in turn become HTTP, FTP, ICMP…<br><br>But modern day communications are increasingly about Data. NDN/CCN routes Data and Interest packets so that you don&#x27;t have to care about hosts anymore, solving a lot of complex problems in the data-sharing apps that IP encompases (think mobility, peer to peer, CDNs…).<br><br>After going through the base principles of NDN/CCN, we&#x27;ll explain how Endless evisions to use it and how GNOME can make use of that shift of networking concept.

    <h3>Progressive Web App - Future of Web</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    A progressive web app is, more or less, another word for a mobile web app – an application that creates a native-like experience through the web. Unlike a native app or a hybrid app that you have to install through app stores, a progressive web app can be viewed simply by going to a URL in your browser.<br><br>The progressive part of the name is something that has come about more recently, and it is certainly picking up steam. It isn’t just a new fancy word for the sake of it, it does imply more than just a native-like app that is hosted on the web. It may depend on who you ask but in general a progressive app may:<br><br>Make use of modern web based APIs<br>Use service workers for offline capability<br>Enhance “progressively” based on the capabilities of the device it is running on<br>Be able to be installed to the users home screen<br><br>Although progressive web apps are gaining popularity, they are still a long way from mainstream use. The two biggest limiting factors are perhaps that many native APIs are still not exposed directly to the browser, and there is not widespread support in browsers for technology important to progressive web apps like service workers (more on that later). There is also the issue of the learning curve for users, most people are acustomed to installing apps from an app store now, but might be confused about “installing” an app from the web. Until these issues are solved, we will likely be creating hybrid apps with Cordova (which gives us access to all of the native APIs we need) for a while to come.<br><br>Regarding Myself<br><br>I have been Google Summer of Code 2016 student and GCI mentor under Mifos Initiative. I have been working heavily on progressive web app since 2016. My GSoC project was also to create a PWA for the community. I would really like to spread the world about PWA.<br><br>My github profile - https://github.com/mbj36

    <h3>Dreaming of a better home media experience</h3>

    We find ourselves in a world where there are an increasing number of ecosystems of computing devices and appliances that (try to) work seamlessly together to allow people to listen and watch what they want, when, where and how they want to in their homes -- on their TVs, tablets, through multi-room speakers, and so on.<br><br>We&#x27;ve made some headway in enabling these in GNOME -- via the Sharing panel, and the massive amount of plumbing underneath it -- but there is a huge gap between what we have, and where I think we need to be.<br><br>So this talk is in three parts:<br><br>1. Where we are -- both in terms of the user experience (Sharing) and the software stack (Rygel, GUPnP, PulseAudio, GStreamer)<br><br>2. Where I&#x27;d like us to be -- what kinds of connectivity do we want to enable? Is it possible to do this with commodity hardware?<br><br>and<br><br>3. How we can get there -- existing pieces to build on top of, missing pieces of the stack to add, and tying it together in a way users can &quot;get&quot;

    <h3>hotdoc as a unified documentation system for GNOME</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    hotdoc is a modular documentation tool with a few interesting features.<br><br>It is quite capable at documenting C / GObject projects, but also offers a nice (citation needed), markdown-based interface for non-developers. A key feature that will be demonstrated is the &quot;nestability&quot; of a hotdoc project, which can facilitate the interaction between library maintainers and the GNOME developer portal as a whole.<br><br>Don&#x27;t expect too many jokes, I&#x27;m not very witty.

    <h3>On mice, touchpads and other rodents</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    In the beginning there was a keyboard. Then came the mouse. Then the touchpad, the mouse wheel, the trackpoint, the graphics tablet, the joystick, the touchscreen, the touchpad without buttons but with pressure, the pen tablet with touch, the joysticks with touchpads, the touchpad with trackpoints, the touch-capable mouse, gestures, ... it all got rather complicated.<br><br>Over the last few years, we had a massive revamp of the input stack on our desktops. This talk is a tour starting with lowest levels of contemporary input devices and their common features and device types, going up through the intermediate levels where we add a lot of the software features (like buttons on a touchpad) to the new bits and pieces we&#x27;re adding to X and Wayland to support these features all the way to the application.

    <h3>GNOME on tablets and SBCs</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    This talk is about making GNOME run on tablets and Small Board Computers. There are 3 aspects to this:<br><br>1) Hardware enablement, before we can run GNOME we really want all the hardware of a device to work properly with the mainline kernel, a standard Linux distro and all FOSS drivers. The first part of the talk will look at what has been accomplished here recently and how this is a fixed problem if you pick the right hardware.<br><br>2) Running in a resource constrained environment, many of these devices have only 1GB of RAM, GNOME currently does not work well with only 1GB of RAM, what can be done to make GNOME use less RAM?<br><br>3) On tablets typically there is no touchscreen, GNOME has limited support for touchscreen only device, what can be done to improve this ?<br><br>The 2nd and 3th parts of this talk are intended to start a discussion on these topics and to enlist the help of the audience to work on improving this.

    <h3>Bringing GNOME home to Ubuntu</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    I am a co-founder and technical lead of Ubuntu GNOME, with our goal to bring a pure GNOME experience to Ubuntu some might wonder where that might be heading given the recently annouced decision for Canonical to drop Unity and switch to GNOME. This will bring a new set of challenges for the Ubuntu GNOME team, while our distro will not likely exist as a seperate entity and we will merge development resources with the Canonical desktop team, we will remain as a community team to avoid the possible distinction between community and Canonical may getting blurred.<br><br>I will open my talk with a brief history of the Ubuntu GNOME project, why we started it and what our goals were. We started the project with goal of bring pure gnome-shell to Ubuntu. At the time GNOME 3 was incredibly broken on both Ubuntu and Debian to the the point of being unusable. We managed to get things into really good shape over the years but there have been challenges, mostly relating to the co-existence with Unity, and having to maintain large patch delta’s to work with Unity also.<br><br>Then comes the exciting stuff what is the future of GNOME on Ubuntu, where does the Ubuntu GNOME team stand in the future? Canonical are already showing some resistance towards core components of the GNOME stack, for example things like tracker and gdm. What part will Ubuntu GNOME play in pushing our visions into the core Ubuntu Future GNOME desktop? I can’t be incredibly specific on this at this point we are still in discussions with Canonical teams at this stage, but all should be clear by GUADEC. This should fill the bulk of my talk, I see exciting oppurtunities ahead and some more challenges going forward before we can get Canonical aligned with GNOME. I will discuss these in detail during my talk.

    Linux distributions have been traditionally put together from individual packages. In case of Fedora it&#x27;s RPM packages.

First, it will be shown what simple compiler options such as ASan or UBSan can do for us to improve security and how to make use of their output.  Then, it will be shown how using static analysis helps to deliver software which is more resilient to attacks.   But also more involved approaches such as fuzzing help us to create software that is harder to exploit. It will be shown how to work with afl for finding crashes in parsers.  Finally, an assortment of practical ideas to protect the user will be presented.<br><br>After having attended the talk, you will hopefully have an idea of what to do in order to further protect the users of your module from attacks.

    <h3>Building a secure desktop with GNOME technologies</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    The move towards Wayland and container-isolated application deployment brings a range of security benefits. But broad isolation isn&#x27;t enough - we still need fine-grained control over access to resources, otherwise it&#x27;s still practical for a single compromised application to leak significant quantities of personal data.<br><br>This presentation will examine existing application isolation mechanisms and identify cases where they fall short. It will then go on to cover existing kernel technologies that allow us to provide even stronger restrictions and control, and how it&#x27;s possible for us to build environments that provide high levels of security without forcing users to give up the freedom to run whatever software they want.

    <h3>The evolution of the GNOME ecosystem</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    Release management in large-scale software development projects requires significant communication and coordination.<br>It is particularly challenging in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystems like GNOME, in which hundreds of loosely connected developers and their projects are coordinated to release software to a schedule.<br>To better understand this process and its challenges, we empirically studied the communication and coordination activities in the GNOME ecosystem over time, and studied developers&#x27; interactions.<br>Through a case study, we cataloged communication channels, we categorized high level communication and coordination activities spanning multiple releases, and triangulated our results by interviewing ten key developers.<br>We report a set of lessons learned that encapsulates our understanding of how the Release Management process function in a FOSS ecosystem, and how it has evolved over time.<br>The result of the empirical research will be explained through the lense of four theories applied to the GNOME ecosystem: the media richness theory, the channel expansion theory, the shared understanding theory, and collaboration through open superposition theory.<br><br><br>This presentation will provide an overview of the evolution of GNOME ecosystem, using the release management as the driving activity to coordinate hundreds of loosely connected developers and their projects, and how it had evolved over time.<br>The presentation will include a comparison with other FOSS ecosystems, the similarities and differences with respect to GNOME as they mature, what they have learned from GNOME, and what GNOME can learn from them.

    <h3>The GNOME Way</h3>
    <p class="summary">
    This year, GNOME turns 20. Over the course of its history, the project has pioneered new ways of working and has set out a powerful mission for itself: from championing usability and accessibility, to establishing the six month release cycle, GNOME has been at the forefront of Free Software development. However, there are also risks for a project that has been running this long: collective knowledge can be forgotten, and it is easy to lose touch with the beliefs that give a project purpose.<br><br>In this talk, I&#x27;ll ask the question: what is it that defines the GNOME project? In attempting to provide my own answer, I&#x27;ll describe the principles that I think make GNOME so important. I&#x27;ll also recount stories from GNOME&#x27;s history, and in so doing make a case for what constitutes the project&#x27;s folklore. Finally, I&#x27;ll ask the question: how do we ensure that, as GNOME looks to the future, the project continues to nurture these traditions?
